# Diffie Hellman IRC Server

Just a simple python server/client thing I made to help me understand more about diffie hellman key exchanges.

It's something pretty much anyone can make, but it did help me learn a bit more about the protocol and how it works, which is also cool.

Feel free to break it too and teach me how you did it! I'd be honored tbh.

**(Don't actually use this it was a PoC for research)**
